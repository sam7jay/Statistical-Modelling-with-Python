# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### COLLECT DATA
Access data using CityBikes API.
Store the API key in the machine's environment.
Retrieve data by calling the API URL and specifying the desired location data.
Convert the data from JSON to a DataFrame.
Convert the DataFrame to a CSV file.
### CLEAN DATA
Remove duplicate and NULL values from the data.
Eliminate unnecessary columns.
Organize the data in a structured manner.
### SQLITE DATABASE
Create a SQLite database using Python.
Define tables and import values from CSV files.
### VISUALIZATION
Present the data using various charts and graphs for improved understanding and visual appeal.
### REGRESSION MODEL
Create a regression model to analyze the correlation between dependent and independent variables.

## Results
RESULTS: the model is not good fit because R-square is too low which show a low correlation.

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)
